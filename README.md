# -OPEN-SOURCE-Snarky-Bot
Snarky Bot is an open-source project for visually programming the behavior and interactions of robotic and animatronic systems, similar to the powerful animation tools found in Bottango. While Bottango focuses on intuitive, industry-standard 3D animation tools (keyframes, timelines, etc.) for physical movements, Snarky Bot adds a unique layer of personality-driven, "snarky" conversational AI and interaction logic.
Core Functionality
Integrated Hardware Control: Like Bottango, Snarky Bot features an Arduino-compatible driver and animation program for orchestrating elaborate movement patterns of custom robots and animatronics without writing a single line of code for the movement itself. Users can define motors, joints, and control their real-time movement via a computer interface.
Visual Animation Timeline: Users can create and edit keyframes and interpolation curves for physical movements, easily synchronizing actions with audio or external stimuli, much like Bottango's core features.
"Snark" AI Personality Engine: This is the key differentiator. Snarky Bot integrates a conversational AI engine specifically designed to deliver witty, sarcastic, and passive-aggressive responses. The bot's interactions are built around a pre-defined persona, allowing it to engage with users in a "dangerously charming" or comically condescending way, rather than a standard, helpful chatbot.
Behavioral Logic & Triggers: The project includes tools for defining conversational triggers and responses based on user input or external events. This allows for complex, context-aware interactions where the bot's movements and speech are tightly integrated within its snarky persona.
Purpose
Snarky Bot is designed for makers, hobbyists, and artists who want to build robotic or animatronic projects that don't just move, but have a distinct, engaging (if slightly rude) personality. It aims to make creative expression through robotics more approachable and fun by allowing users to focus on character design and interaction, rather than complex coding or traditional neutral responses.
